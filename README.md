## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [angular/cli](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
angular/cli@8 or higher
```

## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone ng-Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/cobidev/simplefolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd simplefolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ ng serve
```

Drop your picture and projects screenshots in the `/src/assets` folder

Fill in your info in `src/app/data.ts` file:
  * your personal info
  * images names (not the path only the name without the extension)
  * the projects infos
  * the gradiant colors

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server:

## Deployment on Github Pages üì¶

Run `npm run build` then wait for the project to build.

Push the project to github

Set github pages (source branch: main, root folder: docs)

Note: It might take time or extra commit for the page to appear.
